<h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1>


<p> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    I have read over the years. </p>

<p>
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h3> Ingredient </h3>

<p>
    <em>1can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em> <br>
    <u> 175g of tahini</u><br>
    6 sundried tomatoes <br>
    Half a red pepper <br>
    A pinch of cayenne pepper <br>
    1 clove of garlic <br>
    A dash of olive oil <br>
</p>

<h3> Instructions </h3>
      <!--coomenti-->
<p><strong> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</strong> <br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>

    Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste. <br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. <br>
</p>
<h3> Storage </h3>


<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
